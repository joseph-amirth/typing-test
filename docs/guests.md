# Guests
Users should not have to sign in to access the full functionality of the website. They may create a guest account for themselves with the click of a button and access all the functionality of the website.
The only limitation is that they will be unable to carry over the activity/information associated with the guest account to other browsers/devices without signing in with an actual account.

## Requirements
1. Users should be able to access the full functionality of the website by creating a guest account.
2. Creation of guest accounts should not require any information from users.
3. Users signed in with a guest account should be able to sign up or sign in with their actual account. When this is done, the activity/information associated with their guest account is carried over to their actual account.

## TODOs
Implement this feature.
