# Sharing
All typing tests are randomly generated, but we support sharing of these tests with other users through links. This is useful, for example, when a user has achieved a high score and a friend would like to try the same test.

## Requirements
1. The user should be able to copy a link to any typing test that they encounter (not necessarily attempt/complete). However the opportunity to copy the link to a typing test is lost once it is skipped (either not attempted at all or not completed).
2. The user should be able to copy a link to any typing test they have completed in the last 24 hours.
3. Since it is infeasible to store all generated typing tests' information forever, the link to a typing test should expire within 24 hours.

## TODOs
Implement requirements #2 and #3.
