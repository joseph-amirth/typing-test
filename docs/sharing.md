# Sharing
All typing tests are randomly generated, but sharing of these tests with other users through links is supported. This is useful, for example, when a user has achieved a high score and a friend would like to try the same test.

Doesn't actually seem like a very useful feature now but it's there so...

## Requirements
1. The user should be able to copy a link to any typing test that they encounter (not necessarily attempt/complete). However the opportunity to copy the link to a typing test is lost once it is skipped (either not attempted at all or not completed).
2. The user should be able to copy a link to any typing test they have completed.

## TODOs
Implement requirements #2.
