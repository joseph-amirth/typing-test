# Ghosts
Users are able to share "ghosts" of completed tests so that other users may engage in virtual races against this user's performance in this particular test.

## Requirements
1. Users should be able to share links to ghosts for tests that they have completed.
2. Ghosts for tests expire within 24 hours of the tests' completion.
3. Ghosts for users' personal bests are persisted forever and links to them can be obtained and shared at any time.

## TODOs
Implement this feature.
