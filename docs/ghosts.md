# Ghosts
Users are able to share "ghosts" of completed tests so that other users may engage in virtual races against this user's performance in this particular test.

## Requirements
1. Users should be able to share links to ghosts for tests that they have completed.
2. Ghosts for tests are expired within 24 hours of a test's completion.
3. Ghosts for users' personal bests are persisted forever and links to them can be obtained and shared at any time.

## TODOs
Implement this feature.
